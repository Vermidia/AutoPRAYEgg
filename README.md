# AutoPRAYEgg
AutoPRAY is a C# program which automatically creates a PRAY source file for specifically making a complete PRAY EGGS file from a few user questions. The PRAY source file can then be used by a PRAY Compiler(such as [Jagent](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jagent)) to make a .agent file.

Tips: When you need to enter ages with sprites and bodydata, remember one of the more common answers is 53(Baby, Adolecent, Adult, & Old) and 21 (Baby, Adolecent, & Adult).
